This is the famous Titanic dataset. What I want to do is convert this
to a dataset that looks like it is for a medical treatment. I want to
mask everything but keep the details the same.

1. Turn the passenger ID into a UUID.
2. Survived changes from (0,1) to (Success, Failure)
3. Pclass should change (1,2,3) to (Beta, Omicron, Delta)
4. Name should be dropped
5. Sex should be inverted.
6. Age should become "Treatment Months", and be 3 times whatever the age was. Where the Age is null, impute a mean.
7. SibSp should become "Genetic Class A Matches" and be one more than SibSp.
8. Parch should be "Genetic Class B Matches" and be one more than Parch
9. Fare should become "TcQ mass" and be 1000 times fare.
10. Drop Cabin
11. Change Embarked to "Cohort" with (S,C,Q) -> (Melbourne, Delhi, Lisbon)
