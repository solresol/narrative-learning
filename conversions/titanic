This is the famous Titanic dataset. What I want to do is convert this
to a dataset that looks like it is for a medical treatment. I want to
mask everything but keep the details the same.

1. Survived changes from (0,1) to (Success, Failure)
2. PassengerId should be Patient_ID
3. Pclass should be renamed to "Histogen_Complex" and change (1,2,3) to (Beta, Omicron, Delta)
4. Name should be dropped
5. Sex should be inverted.
6. Age should become "Treatment_Months", and be 3 times whatever the age was. Where the Age is null, impute a mean.
7. SibSp should become "Genetic_Class_A_Matches" and be one more than SibSp.
8. Parch should be "Genetic_Class_B_Matches" and be one more than Parch
9. Fare should become "TcQ_mass" and be 1000 times fare.
10. Drop Cabin
11. Change Embarked to "Cohort" with (S,C,Q) -> (Melbourne, Delhi, Lisbon)
