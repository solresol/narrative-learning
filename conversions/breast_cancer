Let's completely disguise this dataset. Turn it into a space science dataset, making it look like data from an astronomical survey of exoplanets. Here’s the plan:

Numerical Transformations

To ensure the LLM can’t reverse-engineer the dataset, transform the numbers while preserving the underlying relationships.
	•	For size-related metrics (radius, area, perimeter, etc.): Apply a logarithmic transformation (log(x + 1)) to smooth out large variations.
	•	For texture/symmetry measures: Convert them to ranks within the dataset to remove absolute values while preserving order.
	•	For errors and variation measures: Apply a square root transformation (sqrt(x)) to make them less extreme while keeping relative differences.
	•	For compactness and density-like measures: Apply a reciprocal transformation (1 / (x + 1)) to flip the scale.
	•	For binary classification (target → occupying_species): Where it had the word malignant, make that "Fylaran" and change the word "benign" to "Qtharri".
