Let’s completely disguise this dataset. Turn it into a space science dataset, making it look like data from an astronomical survey of exoplanets. Here’s the plan:

Column Renaming (Space Science Theme)


Original Column	New Column (Space Science)	Interpretation
patient_id	exoplanet_id	Unique identifier for each exoplanet
mean radius	mean orbital radius	Average distance of the exoplanet from its star
mean texture	mean surface roughness	Surface irregularities of the exoplanet
mean perimeter	mean magnetosphere extent	Strength of the planet’s magnetic field boundary
mean area	mean atmospheric depth	Average depth of the planet’s atmosphere
mean smoothness	mean tidal distortion	Degree to which the planet’s shape is deformed by tidal forces
mean compactness	mean core density	Density of the planet’s core
mean concavity	mean ring system complexity	Complexity of rings around the planet (if any)
mean concave points	mean impact crater count	Number of impact craters detected on the surface
mean symmetry	mean axial symmetry	How symmetrical the planet appears in infrared imaging
mean fractal dimension	mean cloud turbulence	Measure of the complexity of cloud formations in the planet’s atmosphere
radius error	orbital radius error	Measurement uncertainty in the orbital radius
texture error	surface roughness error	Measurement uncertainty in surface roughness
perimeter error	magnetosphere extent error	Error in magnetic boundary estimates
area error	atmospheric depth error	Error in atmospheric depth measurements

worst concavity	max ring system complexity	Most complex ring system observed
worst concave points	max impact crater count	Highest recorded impact crater count
worst symmetry	max axial symmetry	Highest detected axial symmetry
worst fractal dimension	max cloud turbulence	Most chaotic cloud formations detected
target	habitability_flag	Binary flag: 0 = likely uninhabitable, 1 = potentially habitable

Numerical Transformations

To ensure the LLM can’t reverse-engineer the dataset, transform the numbers while preserving the underlying relationships.
	•	For size-related metrics (radius, area, perimeter, etc.): Apply a logarithmic transformation (log(x + 1)) to smooth out large variations.
	•	For texture/symmetry measures: Convert them to ranks within the dataset to remove absolute values while preserving order.
	•	For errors and variation measures: Apply a square root transformation (sqrt(x)) to make them less extreme while keeping relative differences.
	•	For compactness and density-like measures: Apply a reciprocal transformation (1 / (x + 1)) to flip the scale.
	•	For binary classification (target → habitability_flag): Leave it unchanged, as 0 and 1 remain valid labels.
