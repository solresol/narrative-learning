We have a dataset to obfuscate. We're going to take a Southern German Credit
card dataset, and pretend that it is a dataset about coral reef health.


Column Renaming (Original → Obfuscated)

Original Column	Coral Reef Obfuscated Column	Explanation (Fictionalised Meaning)
laufkont	CurrentFlowQuality	Quality of ocean current around reef
laufzeit	ObservationDuration	Duration (in months) of reef observation
moral	ReefIntegrityScore	Integrity of coral structures
verw	PredatorActivityLevel	Level of predator activity near reef
hoehe	AcousticIntensity	Intensity of acoustic signals (decibels)
sparkont	AlgalCoverage	Extent of algal growth covering the reef
beszeit	CoralAgeEstimate	Estimated age of dominant coral species (years)
rate	BleachingEventsPerYear	Number of bleaching events per year
famges	BiodiversityIndex	Measure of biodiversity (number of distinct species)
buerge	NearbyHealthyReef	Presence (yes/no) of nearby healthy reefs influencing recovery
wohnzeit	ReefMonitoringDuration	Total months since reef was first monitored
verm	PollutionLevel	Local water pollution level
alter	ReefAverageAge	Average age of the reef (in decades)
weitkred	DistantStressIndicators	Signs of stress in reefs further away (yes/no)
wohn	ReefDepthZone	Depth zone of reef (shallow, mid, deep)
bishkred	PreviousStressIncidents	Previous recorded major stress incidents
beruf	CoralDominantType	Dominant coral type (branching, massive, soft)
pers	SurveyorExperience	Experience level of reef surveyor
telef	RemoteSensorPresent	Presence (yes/no) of remote underwater sensor
gastarb	InvasiveSpeciesDetected	Presence (yes/no) of invasive species
kredit (Target)	ReefHealthStatus	Health status (Healthy, Stressed)

Numeric Variables Obfuscation:

Apply these transformations:


laufzeit → ObservationDuration:
    NewValue = OriginalValue * 3 + 7
hoehe → AcousticIntensity:
    NewValue = OriginalValue / 10 + 2
beszeit → CoralAgeEstimate (Years):
    NewValue = OriginalValue * 5 + 1
alter → ReefAverageAge (Decades):
    NewValue = OriginalValue + 3

Target Variable (kredit → ReefHealthStatus):

Original	Obfuscated
0	Stressed
1	Healthy
