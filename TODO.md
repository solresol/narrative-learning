Got it. I'll examine the website [http://narrative-learning.symmachus.org/](http://narrative-learning.symmachus.org/) and explore the solresol/narrative-learning GitHub repository to gather details about the current design and functionality. I'll pay attention to the notes you've shared about styling and visualization improvements, and I'll look into the site's current charts and tables. I will then suggest improvements, including dynamic tables and themes like the one used at [http://pausanias.symmachus.org](http://pausanias.symmachus.org).


The current Narrative Learning site is generated by `export_website.py` in your repo.  It writes out raw HTML with no CSS: the index page displays a simple heading and a list of datasets, and each dataset section shows static Matplotlib charts for test scores over time.  The page has no navigation bar or consistent styling and the charts are static images.  In contrast, the Pausanias site uses a coherent colour palette, clear typography, and navigation tabs; its sections are presented in cardlike boxes with calltoaction buttons.

	### 1  Improve baseline model details

You mentioned an unpublished update that makes the RuleFit details use real column names.  The baseline charts are drawn via `draw_baselines` in `chartutils.py`.  Baseline names are currently hardcoded (e.g., `bayesian rule list`, `corels`) and converted to title case when added to charts.  For consistency:

* Extend the same real column name mapping to all baseline outputs.  You could maintain a lookup dict that maps each baseline to a humanreadable label (e.g., logistic\_regression  Logistic Regression).  Use this dict both when writing the HTML tables and when labelling baseline lines on the charts.
* Use colour coding consistently  the `colours` dict in `draw_baselines` already defines distinct colours for each baseline.  You can reuse these colours in your tables or chips so the reader can easily match table rows to lines on the chart.
* Consider collapsing long rule lists into collapsible panels so the page doesnat become unwieldy.

	### 2  Switch from Matplotlib to interactive charts

The Matplotlib figures are static PNGs.  Modern sites often embed interactive charts so readers can hover to see exact values, zoom in and toggle traces.  Plotly is a good fit because:

* It works in Python (Plotly Express or `graph_objects`) and can be exported as both interactive HTML and static images.  For example, after creating a Plotly figure, call `fig.write_html('figure.html', include_plotlyjs='cdn')` to embed the interactive plot in your site.  For your thesis and paper you can use `fig.write_image('figure.png', format='png')` (requires the `kaleido` package) to produce highresolution static figures.
* Plotly supports horizontally aligned annotations, tooltips, and lines; you can reimplement the baseline lines and ensemble trend lines with interactive hover labels.  Use consistent colours matching your baseline theme.
* Because `export_website.py` generates static HTML, you can insert a `<div>` placeholder and write the Plotly JSON to a separate file or embed it inline.  Avoid heavy JavaScript frameworks; Plotlyis CDN script is selfcontained.

	### 3  Introduce smarter tables with download options

Currently results are inserted as plain HTML tables inside the body of each page.  Users cant sort or search them easily.  A lightweight JavaScript table library can improve usability:

* **DataTables** (jQuery) or **Tabulator** (vanilla JS) can turn a static HTML table into a sortable, filterable table with pagination and column visibility toggles.  Tabulator is easy to use without external dependencies; you can import its minified JS and CSS and initialise it on each table div.
* When generating the HTML, output the table data in JSON as well (e.g., by calling `df.to_dict(orient='records')`) and initialise the table via a short script.  Provide a Download CSV link next to each table by writing the CSV file during export and linking to it.  This allows readers and yourself to download the dataset for usein your thesis.

	### 4  Adopt a coherent style/theme

The Pausanias site demonstrates how a little CSS can improve readability and perceived quality.  To replicate this:

* **Add a navigation bar** at the top with links to Datasets, Models and Lexicostatistics instead of just a small link row.  Use a contrasting background colour and make it sticky.
* **Choose a colour palette** (e.g., earth tones like Pausanias or a palette that reflects your branding).  Define CSS variables for primary, secondary, background and accent colours.  Use these colours consistently for headings, links, buttons and chart lines.
* **Typography:** Choose a clear sansserif for body text and a distinctive serif or bold sansserif for headings.  Set a base font size and line height for readability.
* **Layout:** Wrap content sections in cards with padding, rounded corners and subtle drop shadows.  Add margins between sections.  On mobile widths, stack cards vertically and collapse navigation into a hamburger menu.
* **CSS file:** Create a `styles.css` file in `website/` and link it in every page.  This file defines your variables, resets default margin/padding, styles tables, buttons and cards.  You can also import a minimalist framework such as Bulma or Bootstrap if you prefer not to write your own CSS.

### Additional touches

* Add alt attributes to images and captions to improve accessibility.
* Include icons or small illustrations to break up text (but avoid overse).
* Include breadcrumbs or a sidebar on dataset pages so users know where they are.
* Consider using Jinja2 or another templating engine when generating HTML so that the header, footer and styling are defined in one place.

		By making these adjustmentsmapping baseline names consistently, switching to Plotly for dualpurpose charts, using interactive tables with CSV download and adopting a coherent theme like that of Pausaniasyou can transform the narrativelearning site from a plain HTML dump into a polished, userfriendly web resource while still satisfying your research requirements.
